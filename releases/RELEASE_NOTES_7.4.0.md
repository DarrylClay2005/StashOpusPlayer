# Stash Opus Player v7.4.0

Big visual refresh + artwork performance improvements.

Highlights:
- Visual overhaul: YouTube Music red blended with SoundCloud orange palette. Card-based song rows with larger artwork.
- Now Playing: blurred album art backdrop with gradient scrim; clearer controls.
- Performance: Prefer cached artwork everywhere; reduces decode work and speeds up list binds.

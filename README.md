# Stash Opus Player

## Online Album Artwork (New)

When embedded artwork is missing, the player can fetch cover images online based on the current song's title and artist.

- Sources: MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive (primary), iTunes Search (fallback)
- Caching: Images are stored under the app cache at runtime; subsequent plays load instantly.
- Toggle: Settings -> Album Artwork -> "Fetch album art online when missing"
- Privacy: Only the title/artist are sent as query terms. No audio files are uploaded.

Notes:
- A network connection is required. Respect provider rate limits.
- The app uses a generic User-Agent compliant with MusicBrainz guidelines.
- You can clear app cache to remove downloaded artwork.

A visually appealing Android music player with advanced features and support for multiple audio formats.

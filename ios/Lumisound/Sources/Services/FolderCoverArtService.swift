// MARK: - FolderCoverArtService
//
// Per-folder custom cover art for LocalFolderDetailView — lets the user pick
// a photo to represent a local folder instead of always falling back to the
// first song's embedded artwork (or a generic folder glyph). Deliberately
// device-local only, no bridge/server involvement: stored under
// Documents/FolderCoverArt, keyed by a stable SHA-256 of the folder's
// standardized path so lookups survive relaunches without a network
// round-trip. A per-device cover choice is a reasonable thing to NOT sync —
// unlike library content, there's no "source of truth" to reconcile across
// devices, and the folder's underlying files (which the cover represents)
// aren't shared across devices either.

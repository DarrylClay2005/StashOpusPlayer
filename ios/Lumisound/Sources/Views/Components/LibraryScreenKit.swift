// Detail screens' big redesign pass — deliberately NOT touching `SongRow`/
// `SongGridCell` themselves (used across 15+ other screens and driven by the
// user's own `library_cardStyle` preference plus the Lua custom-style engine
// — silently overriding that on just these four screens would be a real
// regression for anyone who's picked a non-default row style). Everything
// here is the surrounding screen chrome instead: hero backdrops, an A-Z jump
// rail, and a breadcrumb — the pieces that make a screen's *shell* feel
// distinct without reaching into how an individual row renders.

/// swallow touches meant for whatever sits above it — confirmed live: with
/// the drag-based rail, the Home/Songs/Artists pill row above the list
/// stopped responding to taps entirely. Plain `Button`s size themselves
/// naturally (no division, so no collapse case) and their hit-testing is
